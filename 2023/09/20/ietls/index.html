<h2 id="Writing"><a href="#Writing" class="headerlink" title="Writing"></a>Writing</h2><h3 id="Part-1"><a href="#Part-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1"></a>Part 1</h3><h4 id="1-Line-Graph"><a href="#1-Line-Graph" class="headerlink" title="1. Line Graph"></a>1. Line Graph</h4><p>The line graph illustrates details of car ownership in the United Kingdom over 36 years.</p>
<p>Overall, the percentage of people who owned cars experienced a steady（持续的） rise in the past 36 years&#x2F; Conversely(相反的), the proportion of people without cars underwent a notable decline. Among the four categories represented, the group of residents owning either one car or three or more cars constituted the largest and smallest proportions respectively.</p>
<p>The percentage of residents with two cars drastically increased from 8% in 1971 to 26% in 2007. On the contrary, the figure of individuals without cars witnessed a sharp decline. The percentage of residents without cars remained the highest in 1971(48%). Nevertheless, it exhibited a significant drop to 25% in the subsequent 36 years. Notably, the number of people possessing two cars,  initially at 8%, equaled the number of those without cars in 2003 (25%), eventually surpassing the latter group by the end of the period shown.</p>
<p>Throughout the 36-year duration, the proportion of residents owning a single car maintained a relatively stable pattern, despite a minor fluctuation spanning several decades. This positioned it as the largest among the four presented. In 1971, the percentage of individuals with three or more cars was negligible, at 1%. However, over the subsequent 40 years, this figure exhibited a slight increase to 7%, although it still retained its position as the smallest group.  </p>
<h4 id="2-Bar-Chart"><a href="#2-Bar-Chart" class="headerlink" title="2. Bar Chart"></a>2. Bar Chart</h4><p>The provided bar chart illustrates the distribution of residents across various age groups visiting a museum in three distinct years(2006, 2011, 2016) .</p>
<p>Overall, there was an increase in the percentage of individuals across all age groups, except for one specific group(55-64). Among all rising groups, this age group (35-44) underwent a notable increase.</p>
<p>The number of individuals belonging to the age group (15-24) remained constant, starting at 25% in 2006, rising by 1% over the following 5 years, ultimately restoring the 2016 level of 25%, consistent with a decade earlier. Regarding the age group(25-34), its figures exhibited a mild increasing trend, with an average growth rate every 5 years of approximately 14%, progressing from 26% in 2006 to 34% in 2016. Notably, the number of residents of the age group (35-44) drastically increased from 20% in 2006 to 27% in 2016, with the highest growth rate among all groups retained.</p>
<p>Throughout the 10-year duration, the proportion of the age group (45-54) reached its peak within initial 5 years, rising from 20% in 2006 to 30% in 2011, and maintaining stability in the next 5 years. In 2006, the percentage of individuals in the age group (55-64) was the largest(40%). Nevertheless, in the following decade, this figure experienced a slight decrease to 29% in 2016, demonstrating a reduction of 5 percentage points every 5 years. Following a slight decrease, the proportion of the age group (65+), which began at 21% in 2006, declined to 18% in 2011, eventually rebounded with an increase to 23% in 2016.</p>
<h4 id="3-Pie-Chart"><a href="#3-Pie-Chart" class="headerlink" title="3. Pie Chart"></a>3. Pie Chart</h4><p>The provided pie chart investigates the distribution of British students from a particular university who are capable of speaking the second foreign language, excluding English, in two distinct years(2000, 2010).</p>
<p>Overall, the vast majority of students displayed competence in speaking languages other than English, with Spanish being the most favored choice. Among all the students investigated, at least 10% students were incapable of mastering the second foreign language.</p>
<p>The percentage of students proficient in Spanish exhibited a subtle upward trend, progressing from 30% in 2000 to 35% in 2010, maintaining the highest level within the decade. In contrast, French observed a mild decrease, with its percentage dropping from 15% in 2000 to 10% in 2010. Moreover, the percentage of students selecting German as the second foreign language remained steady at 10% in 2010.    </p>
<p>In addition to the above mentioned foreign languages, the prevalence of students speaking another language increased, marking a rise from 15% to 20% over the course of a decade. Furthermore, the percentage of students proficient in two other languages also saw an increase, reaching 15% in 2010. Indeed，over the span of a decade, the proportion of individuals unable to converse in the second foreign language decreased by half compared to the percentage recorded a decade earlier.</p>
<h4 id="4-Table"><a href="#4-Table" class="headerlink" title="4. Table"></a>4. Table</h4><p>The table provided illustrates the expenditures of five countries’ consumers on three different items in 2002.</p>
<p>It was evident that all five countries allocated the majority of their expenditures to  Food&#x2F;Drinks&#x2F;Tobacco, in contrast to the other two categories. Intriguingly, there was a substantial disparity in spending on Food&#x2F;Drinks&#x2F;Tobacco between Turkey and Ireland and the other three countries. However, the variances in expenditures for Clothing&#x2F;Footwear or Leisure&#x2F;Education were relatively minor.</p>
<p>Turkish residents dedicated a significant portion of their expenditures to Food&#x2F;Drinks&#x2F;Tobacco, accounting for 32.14%, which was nearly twice that of Italy, Spain, and Sweden,  with a slight difference compared to Ireland. Furthermore, the proportion of expenditure by Turkish individuals on Leisure&#x2F;Education ranked the highest among all the investigated countries. It was noticeable that the expenditure proportions of Ireland and Turkey on Clothing&#x2F;Footwear were nearly identical, with a smaller gap of 0.20%.</p>
<p>It appeared that Italians were more inclined to utilize their incomes for purchase Clothing&#x2F;Footwear than the four other countries, maintaining the largest percentage (9.0%) among all surveyed countries. The percentage of Spanish expenditure on Leisure&#x2F;Education was the lowest, with a figure of 1.98%. As for the category of Food&#x2F;Drinks&#x2F;Tobacco, the gaps between any two countries among Italy, Spain, and Sweden were relatively small, not exceeding 3.03%.</p>
<h4 id="5-Mix"><a href="#5-Mix" class="headerlink" title="5. Mix"></a>5. Mix</h4><p>The table provided displays the visitor count at Ashdown Museum during two periods. The accompanying pie chart illustrate the percentage of visitors’ level of satisfaction during the same two periods.<br>Overview, there was a slight upward trend in the count of visitors to this museum after its refurbishment, which also had a positive impact on visitor satisfaction(复合句式).</p>
<p>The number of individuals visiting the refurbished museum increased by 18000 , reaching a total of 92000, representing a modest growth rate of approximately 25%. Furthermore, the majority of persons expressed contentment with the museum’s improved condition, as the satisfaction rate rose from 45% to 75%. Notably, the proportion of people reporting feeling ‘very satisfied’ doubled compared to before the refurbishment, reaching a figure of 35%</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s worth highlighting the significant drop in the percentage of visitors with dissatisfied feeling, which decreased from 50% to 20%. More precisely, the proportions of dissatisfied and very dissatisfied visitors experienced drops of 25% and 5% respectively. However, the percentage of visitors without responses remained constant, at 5%.</p>
<h4 id="6-Process-Diagram"><a href="#6-Process-Diagram" class="headerlink" title="6. Process Diagram"></a>6. Process Diagram</h4><p>This provided flow diagram illustrates the fundamental process of harnessing the geothermal energy to generate electricity.<br>Overview, this picture portrays five key steps in electricity generation from geothermal energy. Simply put, the process involves utilizing the geothermal energy to heat the water, which is then converted into steam. This steam is subsequently used to drive the turbine, thereby(从而) generating electricity.</p>
<p>Initially, the cold water is pumped from the earth’s surface down to a 4.5-kilometre-deep injection well. Subsequently, the cold water passes through geothermal zone as it travels to the production well. Once the hot water reaches the production well, where it has been heated by the hot rocks, it is then pumped up to the condenser.</p>
<p>The final two steps of the process are implemented on the ground. In the fourth-stage the high-temperature water undergoes a crucial transformation within the condenser, transitioning into steam. In the last step, the steam, now a potent(有力的) source of energy, drives the turbine. The turbine, in turn, powers the generator, ultimately generating electricity.</p>
<h4 id="7-Improvement-Plan-of-One-Site"><a href="#7-Improvement-Plan-of-One-Site" class="headerlink" title="7. Improvement Plan of One Site"></a>7. Improvement Plan of One Site</h4><p>The provided diagram illustrates the future development plan of a university’s sports centre.</p>
<p>Overview, it’s evident that two outdoor courts will gradually be replaced by the construction of a Leisure Pool , a Sports Hall, and accompanying supporting facilities. Furthermore, the reconstructed sports center provides a wider range of services than before.</p>
<p>Regarding sports centre’s future plans, the current left outdoor court will be removed and replaced with the Leisure Pool. Adjacent to the south side of the Leisure Pool, there will be a changing room. The diagram also indicates an enlargement of the reception area, with the Sports Shop located in the left corner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a ambitious plan for the gym area, which will undergo a significant expansion, doubling its size. The right outdoor courts will be transformed into a Sports Hall, featuring two dance studios on the far right. Additionally, a cafe and a new changing room for students’ leisure and convenience will be located at the southeast corner.</p>
<h3 id="Part-2"><a href="#Part-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2"></a>Part 2</h3><h4 id="1-Two-Part"><a href="#1-Two-Part" class="headerlink" title="1. Two Part"></a>1. Two Part</h4><p>It is undeniable that in some countries, there is a growing emphasis on homeownership among residents. This phenomenon stems from two main&#x2F;primary reasons. However, I contend&#x2F;argue that it has more negative implications than positive ones.</p>
<p>Two main factors, in my opinion, are responsible for residents’ increasing willingness to own a house in a city. Firstly, residents owning a home is deeply rooted in many countries’ traditional beliefs. For many, owning a home symbolizes establishing a permanent foothold in a city. It provides security against eviction（驱逐）, a concern often associated with renting. In countries like China, newlyweds prioritize homeownership, even if it means getting stuck in a 30-year mortgage(贷款). Secondly, government policies play a significant role in fueling interest in homeownership. For example, the policy that reduces the housing loan interest have ignited(引起) enthusiasm among potential buyers. Similarly, tax reductions for home buyers alleviate（缓解，减轻） their financial burdens, further (递进关系)encouraging property ownership.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the current state of the real estate market suggests that homeownership is not an entirely positive situation. Firstly, housing is fundamentally a commodity,which restrict access for a significant portion of the population due to its profit-driven nature. The high prices make it unattainable for many. Typically, those people with a mortgage(按揭贷款) have to allocate a considerable portion of their salaries, sometimes up to one-third,  to repay(偿还) the loan. This financial strain can persist for up to 30 years, significantly affecting their quality of life. Secondly, many house development companies find themselves heavily indebted, potentially impacting their ability to complete projects. Reports of unfinished buildings have become increasing common, eroding(侵蚀) the trust of prospective home buyers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the desire for homeownership in some countries can be attributed to traditional beliefs and government incentives(刺激), but the reality of the real estate market can have negative implications for individuals and society at large.</p>
<h4 id="2-Advantages-Disadvantages"><a href="#2-Advantages-Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="2. Advantages &#x2F; Disadvantages"></a>2. Advantages &#x2F; Disadvantages</h4><p>It’s undeniable that in some cultures, there is a growing emphasis on the perspective&#x2F;belief that children can achieve anything through hard work. This phenomenon has&#x2F;presents three distinct advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, I argue that both sides have&#x2F;carry substantial influence.</p>
<p>Three advantages, in my opinion, are responsible for educators’ increasing willingness to impart(传授) this belief to children. Firstly, it instills(灌输) in them a strong work ethic, encouraging children to diligently pursue their goals. In many countries, especially places like China, working hard is an indispensable factor to succeed in important&#x2F;crucial examinations, which can impact their track of life to some extent significantly shape one’s future. For example, in my personal experience,  I dedicated 10 hours of daily study for 300 days to prepare 2019 National Graduate Entrance Examination, which ultimately led to(doing) receiving an ideal offer from my favorite university. Secondly, this mindset(观念) alleviates the burdens on schools that constantly push their students to get better academic achievements. When students are self-motivated to complete their tasks without teachers’ supervision, it lightens the load on educators. Thirdly, a society with a huge number of residents can contribute actively to the country&#x2F;nation, potentially achieving world-renowned achievements&#x2F;accomplishments.</p>
<p>However, like any perspective, there are drawbacks. Firstly, it’s important to recognize that winners are always a minority, leading to a sense of failure and demotivation among those who don’t achieve their goals. Secondly, schools overly prioritize hard work may neglect other critical factors, such as guidance in the correct direction and exposure to useful&#x2F;valuable experiences, which may damage their reputations. Moreover, students in this environment may become inflexible, resisting alternative approaches and ideas. Lastly, for a nation, an excess of hardworking yet unfulfilled individuals can lead to a society where many feel they’ve exerted maximum effort but still fail to reach their goals. This can lead to dissatisfaction and discontent, with the government often blamed for their inability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I argue that the notion offers distinct advantages for children, but these potential disadvantages should be navigated carefully under the proper guidance from parents, schools, and the nation.</p>
<h4 id="3-Two-Views"><a href="#3-Two-Views" class="headerlink" title="3. Two Views"></a>3. Two Views</h4><p>People seem to have contradictory views concerning&#x2F;regarding children making their own decisions: some argue that allowing children making their decisions independently can lead to selfishness, while others, however, recognize that it(插入语法正确) plays a vital&#x2F;crucial role in their life’s journey. While I acknowledge that validity of the former perspective in certain circumstances, but I am more sympathetic to the latter view, firmly believing the significance of children making choices in the course of growing up.</p>
<p>On the one hand, children tending to do decisions by themselves may be inclined to think the world revolves around them, often ignoring&#x2F;neglecting the feelings of friends, families, even and larger groups. Additionally, these children don’t have&#x2F;typically lack the global view&#x2F;perspective. And without proper guidance, may become shortsighted, which can potentially harm the collective interests. For example, when a group of children decides to play outdoors, each wanting to pursue their favorite activities, conflicts and unpleasant situations can arise.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s crucial to distinguish between children making their own decisions and them (not they) becoming selfish. As children grow, they can develop their positive personalities with the right guidance from families, schools, and society. Secondly, as independent individuals, children are granted the right to make their choices that affect them directly. In other words，their life journey is their own, not their parents’, and they must learn to navigate（驾驭） it. For example, in certain places like China, high school students are required to choose their college preferences before going to&#x2F;attending university. Furthermore, those who make decisions by themselves tend to have clearer goals and are more focused during their college years. Lastly, decisive children play a crucial role in society development, as they often have well-defined objectives and work diligently to achieve them. </p>
<p>In conclusion, it is true that making decision can impact on children’s personalities, proper guidance is a key. Encouraging children to make informed(明智的) decisions as they grow empowers them to be goal-oriented and responsible individuals on their life journeys.</p>
